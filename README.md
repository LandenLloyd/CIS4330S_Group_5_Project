For Dr. Wang's "Smart Sensing and Devices"

## Project Proposal

Sensors:
· Accelerometer
· Gyrometer

Abstract: Many people say they would like to pick up an instrument, but the barrier of entry to
get started with instruments is often too high for potential musicians. However, almost everyone
nowadays has a smartphone on hand. Gesturements is a smartphone app that allows the user
to make music with gestures while holding their smartphone. Gesturements use a combination
of the accelerometer and gyrometer to synthesize music based on a selected instrument. For
example, users could play the tambourine by moving their device back and forth and adjusting
the pitch by rotating it.

Scenario: For many instruments, the costs of purchasing an instrument are high enough to
prevent many from picking up an instrument. Cheaper alternatives, such as GarageBand, exist
for making music, but many apps use a touchscreen interface that does not come close to the
experience of playing an instrument. Our gesture-based app is cheaper than physical
instruments, and the gesture interface is more engaging than a flat touchscreen. Similarly, some
users may have more control over the sound using our gesture-based system than a
touchscreen system.
